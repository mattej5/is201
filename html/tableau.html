        <ol class="text-color-black">
            <li>Too many medications are controlled by government regulation. Consider:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pseudophedrine product purchases are limited each month. You may need to share the medicine with dependents, but you won't be able to pick up more even if you need it. </li>
                    <li>More of the younger generation are suffering from mental focus issues. Adderall and similar products allow them to function normally, but the recent pandemic forced them to live without for too long due to government regulating production, as well as other supply chain issues.</li>
                    <li>Much of the aging population suffers from a variety of conditions that cause pain. Many of these patients can't get these prescriptions because they aren't covered by Medicare, something they may not have planned for before retiring.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Demand for pharmacy services is increasing as the Boomer and Gen X population ages.
                <ul>
                    <li>Those qualified to provide services are being denied the ability to work full-time. Some pharmacy technicians may go weeks without being scheduled to work.</li>
                    <li>There is a need to streamline a patient's ability to understand which medications should be taken. Smartphones and AI should be utilized to make both patient and doctor aware of all medications being taken.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Creating new drugs is incredibly expensive. It doesn't have to be. Consider these options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilize machine learning in drug development, which may decrease costs by as much as 90% in some cases.</li>
                    <li>Reevaluate legislation and lobbying for pharmaceutical companies. Some maintenance drugs can be produced at low cost, yet still sell at high cost despite existing on the market for several years.</li>
                    <li>Allow competitors to develop a generic version of new drugs sooner. Many new drugs exist for as long as a decade before patients can choose a generic drug that is much more affordable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
